# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
## 
```PYTHON
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums = set(nums)
        length = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num - 1 in nums:
                continue
            else:
                count = 1
                while num + count in nums:
                    count += 1
                length = max(length, count)
        return length
