# 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
## DFS
```PYTHON
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None


class Codec:

    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.

        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: str
        """
        string = []

        def dfs(node):
            if node is None:
                string.append("null")
            else:
                string.append(str(node.val))
                dfs(node.left)
                dfs(node.right)
                return

        dfs(root)
        return ",".join(string)

    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.

        :type data: str
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        data = data.split(",")
        self.index = 0

        def dfs():
            if data[self.index] == "null":
                self.index += 1
                return None
            else:
                node = TreeNode(val=int(data[self.index]))
                self.index += 1
                node.left = dfs()
                node.right = dfs()
                return node

        return dfs()
