# 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.
## DFS
```PYTHON
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.ans = float("-inf")

        def dfs(node):
            if node is None:
                return 0
            else:
                left = dfs(node.left)
                right = dfs(node.right)
                self.ans = max(
                    self.ans,
                    left + node.val,
                    right + node.val,
                    left + right + node.val,
                    node.val,
                )
                return max(left + node.val, right + node.val, node.val)

        dfs(root)
        return self.ans
